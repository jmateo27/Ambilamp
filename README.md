# Ambilamp
The goal of this project was to create a lamp that changed brightness according to the ambient brightness of the room. The lamp ultimately overcame this requirement and even got the additional added the feature of changing colours, while it still did its main function. There were many walls to overcome as not much knowledge was acquired at the time. A lot of research about RGB lights were done, some on what effects different colours of the spectrum do to a person. But to get to that goal, we had to do lots of experimentation and research on how to get the required colours. A last feature we added was to give the user the power to change the colour of the lamp at their own will.  The main components of this project were: an RGB LED strip, 2 light sensors, an Arduino, a potentiometer, some diodes and MOSFETs, a battery pack, a 9V battery
